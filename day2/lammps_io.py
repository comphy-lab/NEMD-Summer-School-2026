"""Shared output-parsing helpers for the Day-1 LJ-channel analysers.

These three readers are the shared output parsers for the analysers, kept in
one place so the four
`analyse_<case>.py` scripts parse LAMMPS output identically. The physics
(conductance G, the Couette/slip fit, the viscosity) stays in each case folder.

Import it with the same reach-up convention you already use to run a case
(`cd density && python analyse_density.py`, which `include ../shared_setup.lmp`
mirrors on the LAMMPS side). At the top of each analyser:

    import os, sys
    sys.path.insert(0, os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))))
    from lammps_io import read_profile, read_params, read_timeseries
